# Clickjacking Example - Python

## Building the example

* Clone this git repository
* Navidte to Lab5 and run <code>docker-compose build && docker-compose up</code> Note this may take a couple minutes the first time. It will be faster on subsequent executions since docker will cache the packages that the php container uses.
* Open a browser and navigate to your virtual server
